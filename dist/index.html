          <p>
            I have loved math for as long as I can remember and that was the
            primary reason why I completed my Honours BSc. Math and Stats Co-op
            degree from McMaster. The co-op portion of my degree gave me
            invaluable exposure to data analysis and business analysis at
            Apotex, CIBC, and Hydro One. I am currently working for
            <a href="insights3.ca" class="insights3">Insights3</a> where I
            analyze various datasets such as: doctor level prescriptions, sales,
            and compensation plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a data analyst/scientist working towards becoming a full-stack
            web developer. My dream is to build customized web applications that
            focus on providing a user-friendly data analytics front end as well
            as to build data science pipelines related to processing large
            amounts of data using powerful machine learning libraries.
          </p>

            I encourage you to check out some of my projects I've worked on (or
            am working on) by clicking the job title links above.
